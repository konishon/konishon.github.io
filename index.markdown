## Geo-spatial Data Scientist | Open Source Developer

Welcome! I'm a passionate data scientist specializing in geo-spatial analysis, mapping, and data-driven solutions for real-world challenges. My work focuses on leveraging open-source technologies to analyze geographic data, monitor natural disasters, and build tools that help communities make informed decisions.

### Areas of Expertise
- 🗺️ **Geo-spatial Analysis**: Working with OpenStreetMap, GIS data, and location-based services
- 📊 **Data Science**: Python, machine learning, and data visualization
- 🌍 **Disaster Monitoring**: Earthquake tracking, flood risk assessment, and extreme weather monitoring
- 🚀 **Open Source Development**: Contributing to and building tools for the community

### Featured Work
- **OSM Pathfinding Visualizer**: 2D/3D pathfinding visualizer using OpenStreetMap data with A*, Dijkstra, and BFS algorithms
- **Nepal Peaks Geodata**: Comprehensive geo-spatial dataset of Nepal's Himalayan peaks
- **Extreme Rainfall Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring system for flood risk assessment
- **Nepal Palika Finder**: Fast tool to identify municipalities from coordinates
