## About Me

I'm Nishon Tandukar, a geo-spatial data scientist and open-source developer passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. My work sits at the intersection of geography, data science, and software development, with a particular focus on applications in disaster monitoring, urban planning, and environmental analysis.

## Background

With extensive experience in Python programming, geographic information systems (GIS), and data analysis, I specialize in transforming complex spatial datasets into actionable insights. My projects range from building pathfinding algorithms using OpenStreetMap data to developing real-time monitoring systems for natural disasters.

## What I Do

- **Geo-spatial Analysis**: I work with various geographic data sources including OpenStreetMap, LiDAR, and satellite imagery to analyze spatial patterns and relationships
- **Disaster Monitoring**: Developing tools for earthquake tracking, extreme rainfall monitoring, and flood risk assessment
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate complex data insights
- **Open Source Contributions**: Building and maintaining open-source tools that help researchers, developers, and communities work with geographic data

## Recent Projects

Some of my recent work includes:

- **OSM Pathfinding Visualizer**: A Python-based 2D/3D pathfinding visualizer using OpenStreetMap data, featuring multiple algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, BFS) with dynamic visualizations
- **Nepal Peaks Geodata**: A comprehensive geo-spatial dataset of Nepal's Himalayan peaks, making mountaineering data accessible to researchers and enthusiasts
- **Extreme Rainfall Monitoring (ERM)**: A monitoring system that tracks extreme rainfall events and assesses flood trigger potential
- **Nepal Palika Finder**: A fast, efficient tool to find the corresponding Nepali municipality from latitude/longitude coordinates
- **Nepal Earthquake Epicenter Data**: Automated scraping and analysis of earthquake data from Nepal's National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Center

## Technical Skills

- **Programming**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Shell scripting
- **Geo-spatial Tools**: GDAL, GeoPandas, Shapely, OSMnx, QGIS
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Machine Learning
- **Web Development**: Flask, Jekyll, Git/GitHub
- **Databases**: PostGIS, SQLite

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects related to geo-spatial analysis, open data, and disaster monitoring. Feel free to reach out through [GitHub](https://github.com/konishon) or explore my projects to see what I'm currently working on.
